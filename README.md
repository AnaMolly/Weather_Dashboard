# Weather Dashboard

This weather dashboard was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Moment.js and Javascript. It utilizes the API OpenWeatherApi to fetch the weather data. It returns data about towns, cities and countries. It gives you today's weather forecast as well as the weather forecast for the next five days. It includes temperture, wind speed, humidity and UV Index.


# HTML File
- the html file contains a photo, jumbotron, search form and cards from Bootstrap. 
- the jumbotron was used to display the title of the application. The form was used to capture the user search. The cards were used to display the current weather and the weather for the next five days.
- styling for bootstrap elements were mostly included in the html file

# CSS File
- the css file contains additional styling for the bootstrap elements.


# Javascript File
- the js file contains functions for displaying the current weather, calculating the UV index based on coordinates, rendering the five-day forecast, clearing the search field, saving the past search history and rendering the last search history. 
- it also includes a function that takes the user to their last search when they click on it. 
- it also includes two event listeners, one that listens for a click on the search button and one that listens for a click on the past search history.
